### Greetings  

I am **Lila Josey James**, a technologist passionate about people and their connection to technology. My journey has taken me across the globe, working with diverse clients and teams on a wide array of technical problems. For example:  

- üåç **Consulting Expertise:** Advised MasterCard in S√£o Paulo, Buenos Aires, and Toronto on security and APIs.  
- ü§ñ **State-of-the-art Solutions:** Built state-of-the-art NLP/LLM systems with Georgia Tech in the U.S.  
- üá™üá∫ **Global Collaboration:** Partnered with engineers on 6/7 continents to create bespoke software for data pipelines in the fin-tech sector.  

Whether guiding first-graders or C-level executives, I‚Äôve discovered a universal truth:  
> **The success of any endeavor relies more on how a team functions together than on the sum of individual skills.**
